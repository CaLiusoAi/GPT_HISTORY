ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work.

The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further maintenance are described in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. In particular, the different approval criteria needed for the different types of ISO documents should be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the editorial rules of the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.

This document was developed in response to recurring failures observed in long-horizon research programmes, safety-critical systems engineering, and exploratory R&D environments, where significant discoveries were lost due to fragmentation, truncation, re-ordering, or the infeasibility of transmitting complete artefacts as single atomic documents. The framework specified herein addresses these failures by defining a reconstruction-complete, fail-closed method for preserving essential knowledge without requiring full artefact transmission.

Abstract

This document specifies the Fixed-Point Reconstruction Engine (FPRE), a formal framework for the preservation, validation, and reconstruction of research artefacts under conditions where complete transmission or storage of a corpus is infeasible.

FPRE defines a set of axioms, invariants, and admissible semantics that enable essential research content to be partitioned into formally typed, independently addressable segments. The framework guarantees that, when sufficient information is available, a complete and internally consistent reconstruction can be achieved, and that when information is insufficient, the system fails closed without producing speculative or misleading output.

The standard introduces a terminal fixed-point criterion based on an admissible measurement operator, ensuring that only content invariant under causal, execution-only evaluation is preserved. Explicit negative space is defined to declare classes of information that are provably non-representable within the framework, preventing inadvertent inclusion of non-causal, retrospective, or non-verifiable constructs.

FPRE is designed for use in research, engineering, and archival contexts where loss, truncation, re-ordering, hostile reinterpretation, or long-term temporal degradation are expected operating conditions. The framework is implementation-agnostic and does not prescribe storage formats, programming languages, or execution environments.

This document is applicable to, but not limited to, aerospace systems engineering, defense and intelligence research, safety-critical software development, long-term scientific archives, and exploratory R&D programmes requiring rigorous guarantees of integrity, auditability, and honest failure behavior.

Introduction

(Informative)

0.1 Background and Motivation

In many research, engineering, and exploratory development environments, significant bodies of knowledge are produced incrementally over extended periods of time. These bodies of work often evolve through non-linear discovery processes, informal iteration, partial documentation, and cross-domain synthesis. As a result, essential discoveries, proofs, design decisions, and negative results are frequently distributed across multiple artefacts, formats, and contextual dependencies.

Conventional documentation and archival practices assume that complete artefacts can be transmitted, stored, and interpreted as single atomic units. In practice, this assumption fails under conditions such as:
	•	communication bandwidth constraints,
	•	partial data loss or truncation,
	•	re-ordering of information,
	•	long-term degradation of context,
	•	changes in personnel or authorship,
	•	hostile or adversarial reinterpretation.

When these conditions occur, critical research outcomes may be lost, misinterpreted, or reconstructed incorrectly, leading to repeated effort, invalid conclusions, or unsafe system behavior.

0.2 Problem Statement

The core problem addressed by this document is the absence of a formal, transport-safe method for preserving essential research knowledge when complete artefact transmission is infeasible.

Specifically, existing approaches lack mechanisms to:
	•	distinguish essential structure from non-essential narrative,
	•	detect omission or corruption of critical components,
	•	refuse reconstruction when information is insufficient,
	•	declare explicit limits on what cannot be preserved,
	•	guarantee that reconstructed artefacts remain internally consistent.

In safety-critical and long-horizon research domains, producing partial or speculative reconstructions is often more harmful than producing no output at all.

0.3 Design Objectives

The Fixed-Point Reconstruction Engine (FPRE) is designed to satisfy the following objectives:
	•	Reconstruction Completeness:
Enable full reconstruction of essential research structure when sufficient information is present.
	•	Fail-Closed Operation:
Ensure that insufficient or ambiguous information results in explicit refusal rather than approximation.
	•	Segment Addressability:
Allow artefacts to be partitioned into independently verifiable segments that survive loss or re-ordering.
	•	Omission Detectability:
Make missing or corrupted components provably detectable.
	•	Explicit Limits:
Declare, in advance, classes of information that are non-representable within the framework.
	•	Implementation Independence:
Avoid dependence on specific storage formats, programming languages, or execution platforms.

0.4 Fixed-Point Preservation Principle

FPRE is based on a fixed-point preservation principle. Rather than attempting to store or transmit all information, the framework identifies and preserves only those elements that remain invariant under an admissible measurement process. This approach ensures that preserved content is:
	•	observer-independent,
	•	causally grounded,
	•	free from retrospective interpretation,
	•	stable under repeated evaluation.

Elements that do not satisfy these conditions are explicitly excluded, rather than implicitly lost.

0.5 Relationship to Existing Standards

FPRE is compatible with, but stricter than, existing archival and quality standards. In particular:
	•	It complements the ISO 14721 (OAIS) reference model by providing formal reconstruction guarantees rather than storage guidance.
	•	It aligns with ISO/IEC 25010 and ISO 9001 principles by enforcing integrity, consistency, and auditability.
	•	It extends IEEE verification and validation concepts by requiring fixed-point convergence as a condition of correctness.

FPRE does not replace these standards; it provides a formal layer for situations in which their assumptions about completeness and continuity do not hold.

0.6 Intended Audience

This document is intended for:
	•	researchers and research program leads,
	•	systems and safety engineers,
	•	long-term archival architects,
	•	verification and validation engineers,
	•	standards bodies and regulatory reviewers.

No prior familiarity with the framework is assumed.

Fail-open behavior is prohibited.

10.3 Prohibition of approximation

Under no circumstances shall the system attempt to:
	•	interpolate missing information;
	•	estimate omitted content;
	•	infer intent, prediction, or optimization;
	•	substitute heuristic or probabilistic approximations for formally specified constructs.

Any such attempt constitutes non-conformance.

Failure reporting shall be limited to:
	•	explicit indication of failure, and
	•	identification of the violated requirement(s), where determinable.

Failure reporting shall not include conjecture, inferred causes, or narrative explanation.

11 Explicit non-existence (negative space)

(Normative)

This clause specifies classes of constructs that are explicitly non-representable within a conforming artefact.

11.1 General

A conforming artefact shall explicitly declare the non-existence of the constructs listed in this clause.
Attempting to encode, infer, approximate, or imply any such construct constitutes non-conformance.

11.2 Non-representable constructs

The following constructs shall not be represented within a conforming artefact:

Inclusion, implication, or derivation of any construct listed in 11.2 shall immediately invalidate conformance, regardless of any other satisfied requirements.

⸻

12 Intentional exclusions

(Informative)

This clause describes categories of information that are intentionally excluded from preservation within this framework.

	•	contextual, emotional, or experiential information;
	•	raw data archives or uninterpreted datasets;
	•	visual artefacts beyond formal textual description;
	•	implementation-specific optimizations or tooling details.

12.2 Rationale for exclusion

These exclusions are required to ensure:
	•	transportability under constrained transmission conditions;
	•	invariance under admissible measurement;
	•	detectability of omission and corruption;
	•	avoidance of non-causal or observer-dependent content.

Exclusion of these categories does not imply lack of value; it reflects the scope limitations necessary for correctness and auditability.

C. Non-Normative Example Use-Case Annex

(Informative — not required for conformance)

Annex A — Example application of FPRE in long-horizon research

A.1 Context

A research programme conducts multi-year exploratory work involving formal models, proofs, simulations, and negative results. The complete corpus cannot be transmitted or stored as a single artefact due to size, bandwidth, and organizational constraints.

A.2 Application of FPRE

The programme produces a single FPRE-conforming artefact that:
	•	declares axioms governing admissible content;
	•	partitions discoveries into formally typed segments;
	•	encodes non-equivalence results and explicit limits;
	•	declares non-representable constructs;
	•	enables reconstruction from any surviving subset of segments.

A.3 Failure Handling

If future custodians possess insufficient segments to reconstruct the corpus, the framework produces no output, preventing speculative or misleading reconstructions.

A.4 Outcome

The research programme achieves:
	•	preservation of essential structure;
	•	explicit declaration of irrecoverable loss;
	•	auditability independent of original authors;
	•	resistance to reinterpretation drift over time.

This annex is illustrative only and does not modify normative requirements.

D. ISO / IEC COMMITTEE JUSTIFICATION MEMORANDUM

(Submission Companion — Informative, Strategic)

Title

Justification for Standardization: Fixed-Point Reconstruction Engine (FPRE)

Purpose of this memorandum

This memorandum provides the rationale for standardizing the Fixed-Point Reconstruction Engine (FPRE) as an ISO/IEC standard. It is intended to support committee discussion, ballot justification, and cross-committee alignment.

Problem Statement

Numerous research, engineering, and exploratory development programs experience irrecoverable loss of essential knowledge due to:
	•	infeasibility of transmitting complete artefacts as single atomic units,
	•	fragmentation across time, teams, and formats,
	•	loss of contextual continuity and authorship,
	•	long-term archival degradation,
	•	hostile or adversarial reinterpretation environments.

Existing standards assume complete artefact availability and therefore do not provide mechanisms to:
	•	detect omission,
	•	refuse partial reconstruction,
	•	formally declare non-representable knowledge,
	•	guarantee internal consistency after loss.

Why existing standards are insufficient
	•	ISO 14721 (OAIS) addresses archival structure but not reconstruction correctness.
	•	ISO 9001 / ISO/IEC 25010 address quality management, not loss-tolerant semantics.
	•	IEEE V&V standards verify implementations, not knowledge survivability.

FPRE addresses a previously unstandardized failure mode:

Honest preservation of essential structure when completeness is impossible.

Technical novelty

FPRE introduces:
	•	a fixed-point convergence requirement for artefact validity,
	•	explicit negative space (non-existence declarations),
	•	fail-closed reconstruction semantics,
	•	invariant-driven segment architecture.

These properties are not present in existing standards.

Expected impact

Standardization of FPRE enables:
	•	prevention of silent knowledge corruption,
	•	reproducible reconstruction audits,
	•	safe refusal under insufficiency,
	•	long-horizon research survivability.

Recommendation

Proceed with Working Draft advancement and technical review under ISO/IEC JTC 1.
