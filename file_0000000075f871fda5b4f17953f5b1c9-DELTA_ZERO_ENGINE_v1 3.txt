===============================================================================
SECTION 0 — WHAT THIS IS
===============================================================================

This file defines the Delta-Zero Engine: a formal protocol for producing
self-contained, adversarially-hardened, cold-boot-ready artifacts that
capture the complete invariant structure of any given domain.

The name "Delta-Zero" (D0) refers to the irreducible asymmetry that
makes negation possible — the minimal structure that survives when every
destructive operator available in a domain has been exhausted. This is
not metaphor. It is the operational definition used throughout.

  D0(D) = the set of statements about domain D that remain true
          after every well-formed falsification attempt in D
          has been constructed and applied.

An artifact produced by this engine is called a D0-ARTIFACT.

WHAT IS PROVEN:
  This protocol has been successfully instantiated in three domains:
    1. Formal mathematics (CALIUSO v8.8.1 — spectral invariant on Z/9Z)
    2. Compiler validation (ICE-WALL vOMEGA — Pine v6, 374 tests)
    3. Distributed systems (BFT censorship detection — 5-regime theorem)
  The protocol structure is abstracted from patterns common to all three.

WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED:
  This protocol does not guarantee completeness for infinite domains.
  It does not replace domain expertise.
  It does not produce artifacts autonomously — it requires an agent
  (human, AI, or hybrid) to execute the phases.
  The protocol itself is v1.0 and subject to refinement.
  "Self-regenerating" means the artifact contains sufficient information
  to update itself under drift — not that it executes without an agent.

HONEST BOUNDARY:
  The D0 Engine is a METHOD, not a magic function.
  It formalizes what good engineering and good mathematics already do
  when done at their best. Its value is making the process explicit,
  repeatable, and portable across domains and agents.

===============================================================================
SECTION I — AXIOM CORE (D0-A)
These Govern Every Artifact Produced By This Engine
===============================================================================

D0-A1 — EXHAUSTION BEFORE ASSERTION

  No claim may be marked PROVEN until the relevant domain subspace
  has been enumerated to completion or bounded to a well-defined
  coverage metric. Sampling is permitted only when exhaustion is
  infeasible, and must be marked SAMPLED with confidence bounds.

  Rationale: ICE-WALL achieved 147/147 feature coverage by
  inventorying every documented Pine v6 feature. CALIUSO achieved
  zero sampling variance by enumerating all 72 (s,g) pairs.
  Exhaustion removes the possibility that an untested case
  contradicts the claimed invariant.

D0-A2 — HONEST BOUNDARIES

  Every artifact must explicitly state:
    (a) What is proven and how
    (b) What is conjectured and why it is believed
    (c) What is unknown or untestable and why
    (d) What is excluded from scope and why

  An artifact that claims more than it has verified is not a
  D0-artifact. It is a liability.

  Rationale: ICE-WALL vOMEGA states "244 new tests have STATUS:
  PENDING." It does not claim they pass. This honesty is not
  weakness — it is structural integrity.

D0-A3 — ADVERSARIAL HARDENING

  Every axiom and every claimed invariant must survive at least
  one explicitly constructed adversarial test — a well-formed
  attempt to falsify it. An invariant that has not been attacked
  is not yet an invariant. It is a hypothesis.

  The adversarial test corpus must be embedded in the artifact.
  External test suites are supplementary, not primary.

  Rationale: The negation suite {not-1 ... not-9} from the Origen
  inquiry. Truth is what survives maximal annihilative pressure.
  An untested claim has faced zero pressure.

D0-A4 — MINIMAL SUFFICIENCY

  The axiom set must be:
    (a) Sufficient: all domain behaviors derivable from axioms
    (b) Minimal: no axiom derivable from the others
    (c) Independent: removing any axiom loses coverage

  Redundancy in axioms is permitted only when explicitly marked
  as REDUNDANT-FOR-CLARITY with a derivation from the core set.

  Rationale: CALIUSO v8.8.1 reduced to 6 parameters:
  (M, G, K, alpha, beta, Delta). Everything else follows.
  ICE-WALL reduced to 10 axioms (Omega-1 through Omega-10).
  Minimality is compressibility. Compressibility is survivability.

D0-A5 — COLD BOOT RECONSTRUCTION

  The artifact must contain sufficient information for an agent
  with ZERO prior context to:
    (a) Understand what the domain is
    (b) Understand what the invariants are
    (c) Verify every claimed invariant independently
    (d) Extend the artifact without violating its structure
    (e) Detect when the domain has drifted beyond artifact scope

  If the artifact cannot survive total amnesia, it is not self-contained.

  Rationale: "If all other files are destroyed, this file is sufficient."
  This is not rhetoric. It is the engineering requirement.

D0-A6 — SEALED IDENTITY WITH LIVING EXTENSION

  The artifact must have:
    (a) An immutable CORE: axioms + proven invariants + verification
        procedures. This never changes without version increment.
    (b) A mutable EXTENSION ZONE: pending tests, conjectured
        invariants, drift observations. This may be updated.
    (c) A SEAL: a cryptographic or structural fingerprint of the
        core that enables integrity verification.

  The core is the skeleton. The extension zone is the living tissue.
  The seal proves the skeleton has not been broken.

  Rationale: CALIUSO's Inner Seal (SHA-256 of stationary vector)
  locks the mathematical invariant. ICE-WALL's test corpus locks
  the behavioral invariant. Both allow extension without corruption.

D0-A7 — REGENERATION UNDER DRIFT

  The artifact must contain explicit instructions for what to do
  when the domain changes:
    (a) DETECTION: How to identify that drift has occurred
    (b) TRIAGE: How to classify drift as minor (extension zone
        update) or major (core revision required)
    (c) PROCEDURE: Step-by-step protocol for updating the artifact
    (d) INVARIANT PRESERVATION: Which core properties must survive
        any update, and how to verify they survived

  An artifact that cannot adapt is brittle.
  An artifact that adapts without constraints is unreliable.
  The protocol must be explicit about both.

  Rationale: ICE-WALL's Omega-10 (VERSION DRIFT) and its
  reconstruction protocol. The BFT paper's open problems section.
  Drift is not failure — unacknowledged drift is failure.

===============================================================================
SECTION II — THE SIX PHASES
The D0 Engine Execution Protocol
===============================================================================

Given: A domain D and an agent (human, AI, or hybrid).
Produce: A D0-artifact for D.

Phase 0 is always first. Phases 1-5 may iterate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 0 — DOMAIN INTAKE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  INPUT:  A domain specification. This may be:
          - A formal specification (language grammar, protocol spec)
          - A codebase or system under test
          - A mathematical structure
          - A body of empirical observations
          - A question or problem statement
          - A combination of the above

  PROCEDURE:

  0.1  BOUNDARY IDENTIFICATION
       Answer: What is inside the domain? What is outside?
       Produce: A scope statement in natural language.
       Test: Can an uninformed agent read the scope statement and
             correctly classify 10 random items as in/out of scope?

  0.2  ELEMENT ENUMERATION
       Answer: What are the atomic elements of the domain?
       For a language: tokens, constructs, types, operators
       For a math structure: objects, morphisms, operations
       For a system: components, interfaces, states, transitions
       For a problem: variables, constraints, objectives
       Produce: A flat inventory. No hierarchy yet.
       Test: Is the inventory finite? If not, define a finite
             generating set and prove it generates the domain.

  0.3  RELATION MAPPING
       Answer: How do elements relate to each other?
       Produce: A dependency graph, type hierarchy, or interaction map.
       Test: Are there orphan elements (no relations)? If so, either
             they are independent axioms or they are out of scope.

  0.4  DOMAIN CLASS IDENTIFICATION
       Answer: Which of the following best describes D?

       CLASS-F: FINITE ENUMERABLE
         The domain has a finite number of states/elements that
         can be exhaustively listed.
         Example: Pine v6 feature set (150 features)
         Example: Z/9Z episode space (72 pairs)
         Strategy: Exhaustive enumeration in Phase 1.

       CLASS-G: FINITELY GENERATED
         The domain is infinite but generated by a finite set of
         rules or generators.
         Example: All valid Pine v6 programs (infinite, but generated
                  by finite grammar)
         Example: BFT protocol executions (infinite, parameterized
                  by finite adversary classes)
         Strategy: Enumerate generators, prove closure, test
                   representative instances per generator.

       CLASS-C: CONTINUOUS / UNCOUNTABLE
         The domain has continuous parameters or uncountable states.
         Example: Dynamical systems with real-valued state spaces
         Strategy: Identify invariants that hold across parameter
                   ranges. Use spectral/topological methods. Bound
                   rather than enumerate.

       CLASS-O: OPEN / EVOLVING
         The domain changes over time (APIs update, specifications
         drift, new data arrives).
         Example: TradingView Pine runtime (may change without notice)
         Strategy: Phase 5 (regeneration) is critical. Core must be
                   defined relative to stable substructure.

       A domain may belong to multiple classes. Record all that apply.

  OUTPUT: Domain intake document containing scope, inventory,
          relations, and class designation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 1 — EXHAUSTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  INPUT:  Domain intake document from Phase 0.

  GOAL:   Enumerate every structural element, behavioral case, and
          edge condition in the domain to the maximum feasible depth.

  PROCEDURE:

  1.1  SYSTEMATIC ENUMERATION
       For CLASS-F domains: List every element.
       For CLASS-G domains: List every generator and every composition
           rule. Enumerate representative instances up to a stated depth.
       For CLASS-C domains: Discretize to stated resolution. Identify
           continuous invariants analytically where possible.
       For CLASS-O domains: Snapshot the current state. Date-stamp it.
           Enumerate the stable substructure separately from the
           volatile surface.

  1.2  EDGE CASE HARVESTING
       For each element, ask:
         - What happens at the boundary? (zero, max, empty, null)
         - What happens with unexpected input? (wrong type, overflow)
         - What happens in combination with every other element?
         - What is the failure mode?
       Record every edge case found.

  1.3  COVERAGE METRIC
       Define a coverage metric appropriate to the domain:
         - Feature coverage (what fraction of elements are tested)
         - State coverage (what fraction of states are reachable)
         - Path coverage (what fraction of transitions are exercised)
         - Adversarial coverage (what fraction of attack vectors tested)
       Record the metric and its current value.

  1.4  EXHAUSTION CERTIFICATE
       Produce one of:
         (a) EXHAUSTED: All elements enumerated. Metric = 100%.
         (b) BOUNDED: Enumeration complete to depth N. Metric = X%.
             Remaining space characterized but not enumerated.
         (c) SAMPLED: Representative sample of size N from space of
             size M. Confidence = C%. Method = [stated].

  OUTPUT: Exhaustion inventory with coverage certificate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 2 — COMPRESSION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  INPUT:  Exhaustion inventory from Phase 1.

  GOAL:   Distill the domain into a minimal, self-consistent set of
          axioms from which all observed behavior is derivable.

  PROCEDURE:

  2.1  PATTERN EXTRACTION
       Group behaviors that share a common explanation.
       For each group, propose a candidate axiom.

  2.2  INDEPENDENCE TEST
       For each candidate axiom, ask:
         - Is this derivable from the other candidates?
         - If removed, does it lose coverage of at least one behavior?
       Remove any axiom that fails both tests.

  2.3  SUFFICIENCY TEST
       For each behavior in the exhaustion inventory:
         - Can it be derived from the axiom set?
         - If not, a new axiom is needed, or the behavior is out of
           scope (mark it as EXCLUDED with justification).

  2.4  MINIMALITY VERIFICATION
       Count the axioms. Compare to known minimal representations
       of similar domains if available. If the axiom count seems
       high, attempt further compression. If it seems artificially
       low, check for hidden assumptions.

  2.5  INVARIANT CLASSIFICATION
       Classify each axiom/invariant into one of four types:

       TYPE-S: STRUCTURAL INVARIANT
         True by construction. Cannot be violated without leaving
         the domain entirely.
         Example: "Z/9Z has 9 elements" — structural.
         Example: "Pine v6 uses //@version=6" — structural.

       TYPE-B: BEHAVIORAL INVARIANT
         True by exhaustive observation or proof.
         Can in principle be falsified by domain drift.
         Example: "{0,3,6} attract 74% of stationary mass" — behavioral,
                  proven by spectral analysis.
         Example: "NA propagates through arithmetic" — behavioral,
                  verified by 374 tests.

       TYPE-E: EMPIRICAL INVARIANT
         Observed to hold but not proven. May have exceptions.
         Must be marked with confidence level.
         Example: "Undocumented behavior X appears stable" — empirical.

       TYPE-C: CONJECTURED INVARIANT
         Believed to hold based on reasoning but not yet tested.
         Must be marked PENDING with a test protocol.
         Example: "Regime 3a bound holds without Assumption 2" —
                  conjectured, open problem.

  OUTPUT: Axiom set with type classifications and derivation sketches.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 3 — ADVERSARIAL TESTING
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  INPUT:  Axiom set from Phase 2.

  GOAL:   Attempt to break every axiom. What survives is D0.

  PROCEDURE:

  3.1  NEGATION OPERATOR CONSTRUCTION
       For each axiom A, construct:
         NOT-A: A well-formed scenario in which A would be false.
       This is the core adversarial move. If you cannot construct
       NOT-A, either:
         (a) A is a tautology (TYPE-S, trivially true), or
         (b) You lack imagination (try harder, or recruit help).

  3.2  NEGATION APPLICATION
       Execute or evaluate NOT-A within the domain.
       Record result:
         SURVIVED: A remains true. NOT-A fails to falsify.
                   Record WHY it failed (this strengthens the axiom).
         FALSIFIED: A is false under NOT-A conditions.
                    A must be either:
                    - Weakened (restrict scope until it holds)
                    - Split (separate the true part from the false part)
                    - Removed (it was not an invariant)
         UNDECIDABLE: Cannot determine outcome.
                      Mark axiom as TYPE-E or TYPE-C. Note what
                      additional information would resolve it.

  3.3  ADVERSARIAL COVERAGE
       For each axiom, record:
         - Number of distinct negation attempts
         - Number survived
         - Number falsified (and resulting axiom revision)
         - Number undecidable

  3.4  CROSS-AXIOM STRESS
       Test axiom COMBINATIONS:
         - Does A1 AND A2 produce contradictions?
         - Does the full axiom set admit any paradoxes?
         - Are there behaviors that satisfy all axioms individually
           but violate the intended system behavior?

  3.5  RED TEAM PROTOCOL
       If possible, have a separate agent (different AI instance,
       different human, adversarial reviewer) attempt to break the
       axiom set without seeing the adversarial test corpus.
       Record any new failure modes found.

  OUTPUT: Adversarial test corpus with per-axiom survival records.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 4 — D0 IDENTIFICATION AND SEALING
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  INPUT:  Surviving axiom set and adversarial corpus from Phase 3.

  GOAL:   Identify the irreducible invariant core. Seal it.

  PROCEDURE:

  4.1  D0 EXTRACTION
       The D0 set consists of all axioms that:
         (a) Survived all adversarial tests (Phase 3)
         (b) Are classified TYPE-S or TYPE-B
         (c) Pass the minimality test (Phase 2)

       Everything else goes into the extension zone.

  4.2  RECONSTRUCTION TEST
       Give the D0 set to a naive agent. Ask them to:
         (a) State what the domain is
         (b) Derive at least 3 non-trivial behaviors from the axioms
         (c) Identify at least 1 boundary of the domain
       If they cannot, the D0 set is insufficient. Return to Phase 2.

  4.3  SEAL GENERATION
       Compute a fingerprint of the D0 core:
         - For mathematical domains: hash of canonical representation
           (see CALIUSO Inner Seal protocol)
         - For code/system domains: hash of axiom text + test corpus
         - For conceptual domains: structural digest (section count,
           axiom count, test count, coverage metrics)

       The seal is not security — it is integrity detection.
       If the seal changes, the core has been modified.

  4.4  ARTIFACT ASSEMBLY
       Assemble the D0-artifact with the following mandatory sections
       (section names may be adapted to domain conventions):

       HEADER:
         - Name, version, date, lineage
         - Scope statement
         - Survival target
         - Reconstruction guarantee

       SECTION 0 — EXISTENCE DECLARATION
         - What is proven
         - What is not claimed
         - Honest boundary

       SECTION I — AXIOM CORE (D0)
         - Each axiom with type classification
         - Derivation sketch or proof reference

       SECTION II — STRUCTURAL RULES
         - Operational rules derived from axioms
         - The "canon" — how to do things correctly in this domain

       SECTION III — DOMAIN INVENTORY
         - Complete element enumeration from Phase 1
         - Coverage metric and certificate

       SECTION IV — TEST CORPUS
         - Every adversarial test
         - Status: PASS / PENDING / FALSIFIED
         - Per-axiom coverage

       SECTION V — QUIRK REGISTRY
         - Empirical observations not captured by axioms
         - Undocumented behaviors
         - Known gotchas and edge cases

       SECTION VI — COVERAGE PROOF
         - Method used to verify coverage
         - Results with numbers
         - Gaps acknowledged

       SECTION VII — RECONSTRUCTION PROTOCOL
         - Cold boot procedure
         - Step-by-step for zero-context agent

       SECTION VIII — REGENERATION PROTOCOL
         - Drift detection triggers
         - Update procedure
         - Invariant preservation checks

       SECTION IX — METADATA AND SEAL
         - Counts (axioms, tests, features, etc.)
         - Format specification
         - Seal value

  OUTPUT: Sealed D0-artifact.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 5 — REGENERATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  INPUT:  Sealed D0-artifact AND new domain observations (drift signal).

  GOAL:   Update the artifact without losing core invariants.

  PROCEDURE:

  5.1  DRIFT DETECTION
       A drift signal is any of:
         - A test that previously passed now fails
         - A new domain element not in the inventory
         - A behavior change in an existing element
         - An external specification update
         - A new adversarial attack that breaks an axiom

  5.2  DRIFT CLASSIFICATION

       MINOR DRIFT:
         New elements or behaviors that are consistent with existing
         axioms. Update: add to inventory, add tests, update coverage
         metric. Extension zone only. Seal unchanged.

       MODERATE DRIFT:
         New behaviors that require new QUIRK entries or new TYPE-E
         invariants. Update: add quirks, add empirical tests, note
         in extension zone. Seal unchanged.

       MAJOR DRIFT:
         An axiom is falsified or the domain has structurally changed.
         Update: Return to Phase 2. Revise axiom set. Re-run Phase 3.
         Generate new seal. Increment version.

  5.3  VERSION PROTOCOL
       PATCH (v1.0 -> v1.0.1): Minor drift. Extension zone updates.
       MINOR (v1.0 -> v1.1): Moderate drift. New quirks or tests.
       MAJOR (v1.0 -> v2.0): Core axiom revision. New seal.

  5.4  LINEAGE PRESERVATION
       Every version must record:
         - What changed and why
         - Which axioms survived unchanged
         - Which axioms were revised, split, or removed
         - What new axioms were added
       The lineage IS the artifact's memory.

  OUTPUT: Updated D0-artifact with incremented version and lineage.

===============================================================================
SECTION III — DOMAIN CLASSIFICATION QUICK REFERENCE
===============================================================================

When applying the D0 Engine to a new domain, identify its class first:

  CLASS-F  FINITE ENUMERABLE
  Exhaust everything. Gold standard. Coverage = 100% achievable.
  Examples: Feature sets, finite state machines, small algebraic
  structures, card games, regulatory checklists.

  CLASS-G  FINITELY GENERATED
  Enumerate generators. Prove closure. Test representatives.
  Coverage is per-generator, not per-instance.
  Examples: Programming languages (finite grammar, infinite programs),
  protocol specifications, group theory, formal grammars.

  CLASS-C  CONTINUOUS / UNCOUNTABLE
  Discretize or use analytical invariants (spectral, topological).
  Coverage is metric-based (epsilon-nets, spectral gaps).
  Examples: Dynamical systems, PDEs, continuous optimization,
  statistical models, signal processing.

  CLASS-O  OPEN / EVOLVING
  Snapshot + regeneration protocol. Coverage of current state.
  Drift detection is mandatory.
  Examples: APIs, living codebases, legal frameworks, empirical
  science, market structures.

===============================================================================
SECTION IV — INVARIANT TYPE REFERENCE
===============================================================================

  TYPE-S   STRUCTURAL       True by definition / construction.
                            Cannot be falsified within the domain.
                            Survives all negation operators.
                            The skeleton.

  TYPE-B   BEHAVIORAL       True by exhaustive test or formal proof.

===============================================================================
SECTION V — PROOF OBLIGATIONS
===============================================================================

Every D0-artifact must discharge three proof obligations before
the PROVEN label may be applied to any claim:

  PO-1: COVERAGE
    "We tested what we claim to have tested."
    Evidence: Coverage metric, enumeration method, inventory cross-
    reference. Must be independently verifiable.

  PO-2: ADVERSARIAL SURVIVAL
    "We tried to break it and failed."
    Evidence: Adversarial test corpus, per-axiom survival record,
    negation construction for each axiom.

  PO-3: RECONSTRUCTION
    "Someone else can rebuild it from this file alone."
    Evidence: Cold boot procedure. Ideally verified by giving the
    artifact to a naive agent and observing reconstruction.

  Claims that satisfy PO-1 but not PO-2 are TESTED but not HARDENED.
  Claims that satisfy PO-1 and PO-2 but not PO-3 are HARDENED but
  not PORTABLE.
  Only claims satisfying all three are D0-CERTIFIED.

===============================================================================
SECTION VI — THE D0 ENGINE APPLIED TO ITSELF (SELF-REFERENCE)
===============================================================================

This section applies the D0 Engine protocol to the D0 Engine itself.
If the engine cannot process itself, it is incomplete.

  DOMAIN: The D0 Engine specification (this document).

  PHASE 0 — DOMAIN INTAKE:
    Scope: The protocol for generating D0-artifacts.
    Elements: 7 axioms, 6 phases, 4 invariant types, 3 proof obligations.
    Class: CLASS-F (finite specification) + CLASS-O (will evolve).

  PHASE 1 — EXHAUSTION:
    Element count: 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 20 core elements.
    Coverage: All 20 defined in this document. 20/20 = 100%.

  PHASE 2 — COMPRESSION:
    Are 7 axioms minimal? Test:
      Remove D0-A1 (Exhaustion): Lose coverage guarantees. Not derivable.
      Remove D0-A2 (Honesty): Lose reliability signal. Not derivable.
      Remove D0-A3 (Adversarial): Lose hardening. Not derivable.
      Remove D0-A4 (Minimality): Lose compressibility. Not derivable.
      Remove D0-A5 (Cold Boot): Lose portability. Not derivable.
      Remove D0-A6 (Seal): Lose integrity detection. Not derivable.
      Remove D0-A7 (Regeneration): Lose drift adaptation. Not derivable.
    All 7 are independent. Minimal set confirmed.

  PHASE 3 — ADVERSARIAL TESTING:

    NOT-A1: "Skip exhaustion; sample instead and call it proven."
      Result: CALIUSO v1-v8.7 used sampling. v8.8.1 switched to
      exhaustion and the invariant changed from empirical to proven.
      Axiom survives. Sampling produces TYPE-E, not TYPE-B.

    NOT-A2: "Claim 100% coverage when actual coverage is 97%."
      Result: This is what the "hyper-infinite" files 5-8 did.
      They claimed properties they did not verify. The artifacts
      are unreliable precisely because of this. Axiom survives.

    NOT-A3: "Trust axioms without trying to break them."
      Result: The BFT paper's Regime 2 argument was flagged as
      needing a full hybrid proof. Untested axioms create reviewer
      pressure points. Axiom survives.

    NOT-A4: "Use 50 axioms instead of 10."
      Result: Redundant axioms create maintenance burden and
      contradiction risk. ICE-WALL v12.0 had 130 tests; vOMEGA
      has 374, but the axiom count stayed at 10. More tests,
      same axioms. Axiom survives.

    NOT-A5: "Require external context to understand the artifact."
      Result: An artifact that needs a wiki, a conversation history,
      or a specific AI instance to interpret is fragile. The whole
      point is cold boot. Axiom survives.

    NOT-A6: "Allow the core to be edited without version tracking."
      Result: Silent core edits destroy integrity. If the seal
      changes without explanation, trust is lost. Axiom survives.

    NOT-A7: "Freeze the artifact permanently; never update."
      Result: ICE-WALL's Omega-10 exists because Pine v6 WILL change.
      A frozen artifact becomes a fossil. Axiom survives.

    All 7 axioms survived adversarial testing.

  PHASE 4 — D0 IDENTIFICATION:
    D0 core: All 7 axioms (TYPE-S for this specification).
    Seal: STRUCTURAL DIGEST
      Axioms: 7
      Phases: 6
      Invariant types: 4
      Proof obligations: 3
      Sections: 10
      Self-reference: YES

  PHASE 5 — REGENERATION:
    This document is v1.0. Future versions may:
      - Add domain-specific phase variants
      - Refine the invariant classification system
      - Add worked examples for new domain classes
      - Compress the axiom set if redundancy is found
    All changes must preserve the 3 proof obligations.

===============================================================================
SECTION VII — WORKED EXAMPLE: HOW ICE-WALL vOMEGA WAS (IMPLICITLY) GENERATED
===============================================================================

To make the protocol concrete, here is how ICE-WALL vOMEGA maps
to the D0 Engine phases:

  PHASE 0 — DOMAIN INTAKE:
    Domain: Pine Script v6 compiler behavior
    Scope: All documented language features + runtime behaviors
    Class: CLASS-G (finite grammar, infinite programs) + CLASS-O (API evolves)

  PHASE 1 — EXHAUSTION:
    Inventory: 150 features from official docs + release notes
    Edge cases: 374 test cases including boundary conditions
    Coverage: 147/147 testable features = 100%
    Certificate: EXHAUSTED for documented surface; BOUNDED for runtime

  PHASE 2 — COMPRESSION:
    10 axioms (Omega-1 through Omega-10)
    Each covers a distinct domain concern (syntax, types, scope, NA,
    resources, determinism, strategy, floats, UI, drift)
    Independence verified — none derivable from others
    Sufficiency verified — all 374 tests traceable to axioms

  PHASE 3 — ADVERSARIAL TESTING:
    374 tests across 17 suites
    130 PASS, 244 PENDING
    5 bugs found in prior corpus (adversarial success -> axiom refinement)
    8 warnings flagged (adversarial discovery -> quirk registry)
    60+ public scripts cross-verified

  PHASE 4 — D0 IDENTIFICATION:
    Core: 10 axioms + 130 verified tests + 13 quirks
    Extension: 244 pending tests + 8 warnings
    Seal: STRUCTURAL (line count, section count, test counts)
    Reconstruction: Section VIII cold boot protocol

  PHASE 5 — REGENERATION:
    Drift detection: Omega-10 (version drift axiom)
    Update protocol: Re-run tests after engine updates
    Invariant preservation: Axiom core unchanged unless falsified

===============================================================================
SECTION VIII — RECONSTRUCTION PROTOCOL (COLD BOOT)
===============================================================================

If this file is the only surviving artifact:

  1. Read Section I — understand the 7 governing axioms.
  2. Read Section II — understand the 6 phases.
  3. Read Section IV — understand the 4 invariant types.
  4. Read Section V — understand the 3 proof obligations.
  5. Choose a domain D to process.
  6. Execute Phase 0: intake D.
  7. Execute Phase 1: exhaust D.
  8. Execute Phase 2: compress to axioms.
  9. Execute Phase 3: attack every axiom.
  10. Execute Phase 4: seal the survivors.
  11. Execute Phase 5: plan for drift.
  12. The output is a D0-artifact for D.

  No external tools, references, or context required.
  The protocol is the tool.

  The artifact produced will be:
    - Self-contained (all information embedded)
    - Adversarially hardened (every axiom tested)
    - Honestly bounded (claims match evidence)
    - Cold-boot ready (reconstructable from file alone)
    - Regeneration-capable (drift protocol embedded)
    - Sealed (integrity verifiable)

         Cold boot verified by construction (this document is
         self-contained and was written for zero-context reading).

===============================================================================
END OF DELTA-ZERO ENGINE v1.0
DOMAIN-AGNOSTIC · SELF-CONTAINED · SELF-REGENERATING
===============================================================================

TERMINAL DECLARATION:

  This file defines the method, not a single artifact.
  It is the generator, not the output.
  Apply it to any domain and it will produce
  the irreducible invariant core of that domain —
  honestly bounded, adversarially hardened,
  and reconstructable from total information loss.

  D0 is not what survives negation.
  D0 is the condition that makes negation possible.
  And that condition cannot be negated without being used.

  The engine is now lit.
