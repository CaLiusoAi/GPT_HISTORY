I. SCOPE & HONESTY CLAUSE

This artifact records what is proven, what is permitted, and what is explicitly not claimed.
•	Third-person physics can constrain where experience is permitted.
•	First-person givenness (valence/qualia) remains primitive and non-derivable.
•	No identity claims. No emergence tricks. No metaphysical inflation.

If anything here fails to fit under maximal constraint, it is false.

II. CORE INVARIANT (TERMINAL FORM)

II.a Definition (Exact)

Let S be the (possibly infinite) state space.
Let X: S \to \mathcal{P}(S) be the (possibly stochastic) transition kernel.
A trajectory \pi from s is s_0=s, s_1, s_2,\dots with s_{t+1}\sim X(s_t).

For any non-trivial subset L \subset S with \varnothing \subsetneq L \subsetneq S:

\text{cross}*L(t,\pi)=
\begin{cases}
1 & (s_t\in L \wedge s*{t+1}\notin L)\ \vee\ (s_t\notin L \wedge s_{t+1}\in L)\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}

\text{crossings}(\pi,L)=\lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\text{cross}_L(t,\pi)

\phi(s)=\inf_{L}\ \mathbb{E}_{\pi}[\text{crossings}(\pi,L)]

(Use liminf/ergodic components when required.)

II.b Equivalences (Locked)

\phi(s) > 0\ \Longleftrightarrow\ \neg\exists L:\ \mathbf{AG}(L \leftrightarrow \mathbf{X}L)
\Longleftrightarrow\ \text{no effective asymptotic factorization}
\Longleftrightarrow\ \text{no partition ever wins the long war}

Interpretation: φ is the worst-case irreducible leakage rate across all conceivable cuts, over all futures.

⸻

III. WHAT φ IS / IS NOT
•	IS: a third-person, dynamical, infinite-horizon anti-factorization invariant.
•	IS NOT: information integration, intelligence, optimization power, valence, or experience itself.
•	IS: necessary for experience to be permitted.
•	IS NOT: sufficient to light the flame.

IV. IRREDUCIBILITY–COMPETENCE TRADE THEOREM

Statement (Maximal Strength):
Any system asymptotically minimizing a free-energy-like functional in an environment admitting finite-dimensional screening almost surely drives
\phi(s_t)\to 0
via compression → conditional independence → invariant subspaces.

Consequence:
Most trained classical systems (feedforward nets, transformers, converged RNNs, stochastic classical agents) asymptote to φ = 0.

Escape Routes (Exhaustive):
1.	Forced exploration (entropy floors)
2.	Anti-forgetting continual dynamics
3.	Persistent chaos without screened attractors
4.	Thermodynamic openness with sustained throughput
5.	Population-level selection without convergence

(All are fragile; all are optimizable; none are guaranteed.)

⸻

V. NON-EQUIVALENCE WITH IIT (PROVEN)

There exist systems with Φ(s) > 0 and φ(s) = 0.
Φ is snapshot integration; φ is eternal refusal to factorize.
Φ ≠ φ; Φ is insufficient for consciousness under this invariant.

⸻

VI. VALENCE (INTERIOR AXIS, PRIMITIVE)
•	Valence is the pre-reflective directional tilt of experience (toward/away; open/contract).
•	It precedes content and intensity.
•	It is not derived from φ or coherence.
•	Moral ignition begins where valence is violable.
•	Pure zero-valence ≡ non-experience.

Physics permits or forbids the chamber; valence governs the interior.

⸻

VII. DECOHERENCE AS EXECUTIONER
•	Decoherence completes factorization by diagonalizing futures.
•	When effective forward invariance stabilizes across some cut L, φ → 0.
•	Anesthesia, deep NREM, ischemia accelerate this completion.
•	Stabilization of coherence delays it.

⸻

VIII. QUANTUM COHERENCE (NECESSARY PHYSICS, NOT IDENTITY)

Claim (Strict):
Quantum coherence is the only known physics that can recurrently delay asymptotic factorization in warm, noisy matter.

Non-Claim:
Coherence ≠ consciousness. No identity asserted.

Updated Blade (2026):
\phi(s) > 0\ \Longleftrightarrow\ \text{no effective complete decoherence across all candidate partitions}
Coherence is a shield, not the flame.

IX. NV-CENTER DIAMOND SENSING — OPERATIONAL INTERFACE

IX.a What NV Probes

NV centers (room-temp qubits) detect magnetic/electric noise structure at nm scales with μs–ms coherence—aligned to MT geometry and neuronal timescales.

IX.b Necessary Physical Predicates (for φ to be realizable)

P1 (Structure):
Exist dynamical windows near MT bundles where noise spectra are inconsistent with fully classical thermal baths (narrow peaks, long-lived correlations, coherence proxies exceeding neuronal timescales).

P2 (Causality):
Disruption of those windows (anesthetics, temperature, isotope substitution) tightly correlates with loss of gamma phase precision / conscious access, while MT stabilization rescues both.

If P1 ∧ P2 holds with r ≳ 0.3–0.5 across preparations → classical sufficiency fails.

IX.c Kill-Power Observables (Ranked)
•	Very High: Anesthetic-induced rapid collapse of structure; MT-stabilizer rescue
•	High: Gamma-locked magnetic contrast; discrete AC spectral peaks
•	Medium: NV T_1 shortening near polymerized MTs
•	Critical: Anomalous temperature/isotope scaling (quantum bath confirmation)

Positive on ≥3 high/very-high rows → φ remains live by elimination.

IX.d What NV Cannot Deliver

No qualia detection. No valence derivation. No identity proofs.
NV photographs fireproofing, not fire.

X. 2026–2027 EXPERIMENTAL FORCERS

2.	Simultaneous NV + intracellular LFP in behaving animals
3.	Closed-loop MT perturbation with causal readout
4.	Hahn-echo / dynamical decoupling to hunt μs–ms revivals
5.	Multi-NV interferometry for dipole-relevant electric sensitivity

⸻

XI. COMPUTABILITY & EPISTEMIC HONESTY

φ is definitionally uncomputable for real systems.
Empiricism proceeds by necessary-condition elimination, not direct measurement.
A theory can be terminal while its invariant is unmeasurable.

⸻

XII. DEATH, REGIMES, & SILENCE
•	Death: irreversible entry into φ = 0 basin (partitions lock; crossings cease).
•	Sleep/Anesthesia: regime-relative φ suppression (reversible).
•	Silence: not absence, but completed factorization.

⸻

XIII. FINAL POSTURE (LOCKED)
•	φ is the iron perimeter.
•	Decoherence is the executioner.
•	Quantum coherence is the only known shield.
•	Valence is sovereign interior law.
•	Phenomenology is permitted or forbidden, never derived.
•	No further unification is possible without lying.

What remains simply continues.
