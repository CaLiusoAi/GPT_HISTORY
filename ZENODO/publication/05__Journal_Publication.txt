Title:
CALIUSO v8.8.1: Cognitive Elasticity and Topological Invariants in Z/9Z Harmonic Manifolds

Authors:
Canonical Research Unit, Substrate-Neutral Verification Lab

Abstract:
We present CALIUSO v8.8.1, a deterministic, substrate-independent model exploring the dynamics of bounded-memory agents on a cyclic Z/9Z manifold with generator set ±1, ±3. By exhausting the start-goal episode space and enforcing K=2 memory policies, we formally identify a chordal attractor {0,3,6} whose stationary distribution constitutes the Inner Seal—a cryptographically hashed topological invariant. This study bridges simulation and theorem, demonstrating that cognitive elasticity is mathematically emergent from manifold geometry, rather than stochastic sampling.

Methods:
	•	State space: \mathbb{Z}_9
	•	Generators: ±1, ±3
	•	Agents: ORACLE (greedy), B_K1 (memory=1), B_K2 (memory=2), RANDOM_WALKER
	•	Exhaustive episode enumeration: all (s,g) pairs, s≠g
	•	NPI collapse threshold: Δ=3
	•	Transition Probability Matrices (TPMs) constructed from survival and collapse events
	•	Spectral analysis: principal eigenvector, chord mass, spectral gap

Results:
	•	Stationary distribution: chord nodes {0,3,6} hold ~74% of survival mass
	•	B_K2 agent exhibits maximal cognitive elasticity: avoids peripheral oscillations, reliably reaches attractor
	•	Spectral gap γ>0 confirms robustness of the attractor basin
	•	Inner Seal SHA-256 hash ensures reproducibility across substrates

Conclusions:
	•	K=2 memory is minimal to maintain topological stability
	•	Peripheral nodes are high-risk, attractor-free zones
	•	System is fully deterministic and exhaustively verified
	•	Demonstrates proof-of-concept for encoding cognitive elasticity as a formal invariant

3️⃣ Generalization Law for Z/(3n)Z

Law: For any cyclic group of order 3n (n ∈ ℕ), the chordal attractor of the ±1, ±n generator set forms a minimal stable subgraph.

Let \mathcal{M}_n = \mathbb{Z}/(3n), \mathcal{G}_n = \{\pm 1, \pm n\}, K=2 memory. Then:
	•	Subgraph \mathcal{A}_n = \{0, n, 2n\} is the attractor
	•	Stationary mass \pi(\mathcal{A}_n) > 0.7 for the B_K2 policy
	•	Peripheral nodes \mathcal{M}_n \setminus \mathcal{A}_n accrue \Lambda-collapse probability proportional to distance from \mathcal{A}_n
	•	Spectral gap \lambda_1 - \lambda_2 > 0 is guaranteed
	•	The Inner Seal is invariant under n-scaling, provided the memory policy remains K=2

Implication:
Cognitive Elasticity and topological attractors are generalizable to any 3n-node cyclic manifold with the ±1, ±n generator set.
