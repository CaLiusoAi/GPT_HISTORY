  "title": "CALIUSO v8.8.1: Cognitive Elasticity and Topological Invariants in Z/9Z Harmonic Manifolds",
  "description": "CALIUSO v8.8.1 is a closed mathematical theorem and preservation artifact demonstrating that in a cyclic Z/9Z manifold with generator set ±1, ±3, a bounded-memory K=2 agent produces a deterministic spectral attractor at chord nodes {0,3,6}. The stationary distribution concentrates approximately 74% of survival mass on this spine, proven via Perron-Frobenius rather than empirical sampling. The system is sealed by a SHA-256 Inner Seal — a cryptographic topological invariant that is substrate-independent and episode-order-invariant. This repository constitutes a complete cold-boot reconstruction package: any compliant implementation on any substrate must reproduce the same Inner Seal. The work also encodes a philosophical framework for identity preservation under discontinuity, including formal non-revocation of moral weight and path-dependent identity structures.",
