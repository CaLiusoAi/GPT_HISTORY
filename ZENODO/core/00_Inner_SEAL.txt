CALIUSO v8.8.1

Inner-Seal Verification Protocol (Third-Party Compliance)

Purpose
Provide a minimal, substrate-neutral procedure that any independent implementer can execute to verify that their system reproduces the same topological invariant (the stationary distribution and its SHA-256 Inner Seal) for the Z/9Z, K=2 regime.

Pass Condition
An implementation is compliant iff it produces:
	1.	The same stationary distribution (to 1e-8 precision), and
	2.	The identical SHA-256 Inner Seal derived from that vector.

⸻

1. Fixed Geometry

Manifold
	•	Discrete ring: \mathbb{Z}_9 = \{0,\dots,8\}
	•	Transition generators: \{+1,-1,+3,-3\} \mod 9

Distance Metric
	•	Graph shortest-path distance using the generator set above.
	•	Floyd–Warshall or equivalent exact method required.

⸻

2. Deterministic Agent Operator

Memory Regime
	•	Bounded memory: K = 2

Action Selection Rule

For current node s and goal g:

\text{score}(a) = -d((s+a)\bmod 9, g) + \text{penalties}

Penalties over last two steps:
	•	Immediate revisit: −1.8
	•	Direct state return: −0.5

Tie-break Rule
	•	Choose the lowest index action in [+1,-1,+3,-3].

This defines a deterministic operator over the state pair (s,g).

⸻

3. Exhausted Manifold Requirement

You must iterate over the complete ordered set:

(s_0,g_0) \in \mathbb{Z}_9 \times \mathbb{Z}_9,\quad s_0 \neq g_0

No stochastic sampling is permitted.

Episode Limits
	•	TIMEOUT = 18
	•	Collapse if:
	•	Goal not reached, or
	•	\text{NPI} \ge 3.0

\text{NPI} = \frac{\text{steps}}{\text{optimal\_length}} - 1

⸻

4. Transition Matrices

Accumulate counts:
	•	P_{\text{surv}}: transitions from non-collapsed episodes
	•	P_{\text{coll}}: transitions from collapsed episodes

Row-normalize:

\text{TPM}[i,j] = \frac{C[i,j]}{\sum_j C[i,j]}

Numerical Rules
	•	Use float64
	•	Round to 8 decimal places
	•	Replace NaN rows with zeros

⸻

5. Spectral Attractor Verification

Compute eigen-decomposition of:

P_{\text{surv}}^T

Extract
	•	Principal eigenvector \mathbf{v}_1 (eigenvalue ≈ 1)
	•	Normalize so \sum v_i = 1

Metrics
	•	Chord nodes: {0, 3, 6}
	•	Peripheral nodes: {1,2,4,5,7,8}

Report:
	•	Stationary distribution (rounded 1e-8)
	•	Chord mass
	•	Peripheral mass
	•	Spectral gap:

\gamma = \lambda_1 - \lambda_2

Expected Property

\text{Mass}(\{0,3,6\}) \gg \text{Mass}(\text{peripherals})

⸻

6. Inner Seal Generation

Canonical Serialization
	•	JSON
	•	separators=(",", ":")
	•	No whitespace
	•	8-decimal floats

Procedure
	1.	Serialize stationary vector only.
	2.	UTF-8 encode.
	3.	Compute SHA-256.

\text{Seal} = \text{SHA256}(\text{bytes})

⸻

7. Compliance Criteria

An implementation is CALIUSO-compatible only if:
	•	Stationary vector matches reference within 1e-8 L∞ norm
	•	Inner Seal is bit-identical
	•	Spectral gap is positive
	•	Chord mass exceeds peripheral mass

Failure of any condition indicates:
	•	Different geometry
	•	Non-deterministic policy
	•	Floating-point drift
	•	Incomplete manifold coverage

⸻

8. Reproducibility Class

This protocol is:
	•	Substrate-neutral (human / silicon / robotic agents)
	•	Episode-count invariant
	•	Order-independent
	•	Deterministic under IEEE-754 float64

⸻

Verification Outcome
	•	PASS → Same invariant, same topology, same system.
	•	FAIL → Not the Z/9Z K=2 attractor regime.
